       "' Although they were very nice and did their job well the room service cleaning service was aggressive and overbearing They start cleaning very early in the morning and if you forget to put the don t disturb sign on the knob they ll wake you up and try to come in One time the cleaner was waiting outside our door when we left for breakfast and asked us to clean the room even though we were only going to be downstairs for 15 minutes or so I felt pressured to allow them to clean There is also someone who comes around 7pm to close the curtains leave apples and prepare the beds for sleeping and although I guess they mean that as an extra touch it feels quite invasive They also knock several times and try to come in which almost lead to a situation where the person walked in on me having a shower Speaking of which the bathroom is unfit for seniors as the bathtub is very high hard to get into and out of and water from the shower gets outside and floods the bathroom even if you re careful   The hotel is in a very nice neighborhood with quiet streets all around There are some nice parks close by and good restaurants within walking distance It s far from the hustle and bustle of the city center but there are tram lines within a 5 minute walk that will take you there in 20 min or less so it was definitely a very good location The staff at the front desk was always very pleasant and attentive going above and beyond to help you with all your needs   The reception wasn t as clean and crisp as what the photos show The lift is also TINY and quite slow so pack light as you don t want to be doing multiple trips   The view from our room was incredible The bed was very comfortable and the decor was interesting at first but I loved it when I jumped into bed Great idea   The toilet flusher always got stuck when pressed and it was troublesome to always spend a couple extra minutes in the bathroom trying to get it unstuck The furniture was a bit weathered e g cigarette burns on the sofa At check in we were ask whether we d liked to pay upfront or upon checkout Opting to pay at checkout we were asked for the card and they reserved the whole amount on it no PIN number required on a PIN and chip card This rendered the whole sum unavailable on the card At checkout all they had to do was press a button on their side and the sum was withdrawn from the account Essentially we paid at check in with no PIN number confirmation even though we had opted to pay at checkout This felt fishy Fortunately we had no issue because of it but it did not feel very secure straightforward nor trustworthy   A bus ride or 30 minute walk away from the city center Very comfortable bed Quiet and clean Spacious room Safe box in the room  Tried to check into our room at 2 15 pm and was told that we couldn t for at least 45 mins We had plans and these were sadly ruined because we were unable to change and shower in our room which we had paid for to check in at 2 00 pm We weren t even given a courtesy refund or the opportunity to stay an extra hour the following day Very disappointing   Location was good  I know the maid came in and made the bed and cleaned the bathroom but the room was never swept mopped or vacuumed not sure how you clean the floors the dust and hair was never cleaned up and there were never any extra towels in the bathroom like I requested in my reservation I also did not like the fact that the iron and ironing board had to go back every time I finished there should be one in each room and I did not like that I had to leave my room key every time I left   The breakfast was very nice and the bed was really comfy The location of the hotel was easily accessed by foot but did not seem so by taxi the area was clean and safe to walk '"
