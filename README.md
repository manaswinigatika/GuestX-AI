1. ass1_dining_xgboost.ipynb -  develops an XGBoost-based machine learning model to predict a customerâ€™s favorite dish based on dining preferences and behavior. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, one-hot encoding, and time-aware model training. The system ensures real-world applicability by handling missing data, optimizing hyperparameters, and evaluating model performance using accuracy, log loss, and feature importance analysis.
2. training_and_features.py preprocesses data, generates features, and trains an XGBoost model for dish recommendations, while demo.py is a Streamlit app that uses the model to predict dishes and display discounts based on user inputs.
